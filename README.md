# lein-diff

**This project is still in early and intermittent development. This
file is full of lies.**

A Leiningen plugin to perform diffs of transitive dependencies between
different versions of a project.

## Motivation

Looking at diffs of a project.clj only tells you what explicit
dependencies have changed, not how your transitive dependencies have
changed. What if the new version of clj-http brought in a new version
of ApacheHttpClient with different behavior? What if reordering your
dependencies changed which version of a transitive dep was pulled in?

lein-diff is intended to ferret out these differences. The goal is to
support build infrastructure such that a build agent can annotate a
GitHub pull request with a list of changed dependencies, or support
scripting such that a git bisect command can determine where a
transitive dependency changed.

## Usage

Put `[lein-diff "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
lein-diff 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Then execute this inside a project:

```bash
lein diff HEAD^ HEAD
```

...and... *something* comes out. At last revision of the README, you
get something like this:

```clojure
{:changed ([org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1" "1.6.0"]),
 :added
 {com.netflix.rxjava/rxjava-clojure "0.19.1",
  com.netflix.rxjava/rxjava-core "0.19.1"},
 :removed
 {robert/hooke "1.3.0",
  org.clojure/algo.monads "0.1.4",
  org.clojure/tools.macro "0.1.0",
  org.clojars.runa/clj-schema "0.9.3"}}
```

More generally, the syntax is `lein diff <from> <to>` where `<from>`
and `<to>` are git revision coordinates. (See `man 7 gitrevisions`.)
These might look like `HEAD:project.clj` or
`ba68a0:common/project.clj` or `my-branch~3:project.clj`. If the
revspec doesn't contain a path (such as simply `HEAD` or
`my-branch~3`, the path is assumed to be `./project.clj`.

### Examples

- `lein diff abcdef^ abcdef` shows what commit `abcdef` changed
  relative to its first parent
- `lein diff $(git merge-base master HEAD) HEAD` shows the changes
  you've made since forking from master (but not staged changes or
  changes in the working directory)
- `lein diff HEAD ""` shows the staged changes to project.clj (`:path`
  specifies a blob in the index in git)
- `lein diff move-it^:old-path/project.clj move-it:new-path/project.clj`
  compares a project.clj file that moved during the last commit on
  a branch.

## Limitations

- Cannot handle branches with some weird names, notably ones starting
  with a hyphen or containing a colon.
- Cannot diff working directory with git index or history.
- Only understands git, not other SCMs.

## TODO

- Allow specifying weird branches and paths that would make for
  ambiguous or unusable git revspecs.
- Allow references to filesystem instead of git.
- Allow references to other SCMs... or maybe just command outputs.
